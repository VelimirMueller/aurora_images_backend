"""Corrections from users, recalled when the same picture comes back.

A correction is keyed by the picture's 64-bit difference hash, not by a semantic embedding:
SigLIP embeddings cannot tell "the same photo, resized" (cosine down to 0.87 on the eval set)
from "another photo of the same kind of thing" (up to 0.90), so an embedding threshold would
either miss re-uploads or leak one image's correction onto other images. dHash separates the
two: re-encodes and resizes differ by at most 6 bits, distinct images by at least 15.
